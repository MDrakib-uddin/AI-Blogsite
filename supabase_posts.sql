  'evolution-of-gans',
  'Explore the development of GAN architectures, highlighting key milestones like Progressive GAN, StyleGAN-1, StyleGAN-2, and the latest advancements in StyleGAN-3.',
  '<h2>Introduction to GANs</h2>
  <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the field of generative AI since their introduction in 2014. The concept of pitting two neural networks against each other - a generator and a discriminator - has opened up new possibilities in image generation, style transfer, and creative AI applications.</p>
  
  <h2>The Original GAN Architecture</h2>
  <p>The original GAN proposed by Ian Goodfellow introduced the fundamental concept of adversarial training. The generator creates fake samples while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. This adversarial process leads to increasingly realistic generated content.</p>
  
  <h2>Progressive GAN</h2>
  <p>Progressive GAN introduced the concept of progressive growth, where networks are trained starting from low resolution and gradually adding layers to increase resolution. This approach significantly improved training stability and generated image quality.</p>
  
  <h2>StyleGAN Series</h2>
  <p>StyleGAN-1 introduced adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) and style-based generation, allowing for better control over generated images. StyleGAN-2 improved upon this by addressing artifacts and introducing path length regularization.</p>
  
  <h2>StyleGAN-3: The Latest Advancement</h2>
  <p>StyleGAN-3 represents the latest evolution, introducing alias-free architecture that eliminates texture sticking and improves image quality. The new architecture uses continuous signal processing principles to create more natural-looking images.</p>
  
  <h2>Applications and Impact</h2>
  <p>These advancements have enabled applications in digital art, fashion design, game development, and even scientific research. The ability to generate high-quality, controllable images has opened new creative possibilities.</p>
  
  <h2>Future Directions</h2>
  <p>As GAN technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated architectures that address current limitations while expanding the creative potential of generative AI.</p>',
